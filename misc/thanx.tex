\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Robert Buhren for giving me this opportunity to work on a very exciting topic for my Master Thesis and introducing me to a new challenging domain of virtualization. The door to his office was always open whenever I ran into a problem or had any questions related to research. He had allowed me to work independently on designing implementation strategies of research, but guided me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it. I also want to thank everybody at Security in Telecommunications group at TU Berlin for the wonderful time, especially, Jan Nordholz for sharing his wisdom and answering all my questions.
